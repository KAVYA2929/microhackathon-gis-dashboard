# TANFINET – Optical Fiber Predictive Surveillance & Intrusion Detection System

## 📡 Project Overview

TANFINET Optical Fiber Monitoring System is an advanced predictive surveillance and intrusion detection dashboard designed to monitor, analyze, and predict optical fiber damage across Tamil Nadu.

This system integrates real-time sensor data, GIS mapping, predictive risk scoring, and historical analytics to prevent cable damage before failure occurs.

The project demonstrates how an industrial-level optical fiber protection system can operate using sensor fusion and predictive analytics.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Optical fiber cables in Tamil Nadu are frequently damaged due to:

• Unauthorized drilling  
• Heavy vehicle vibrations  
• Cable exposure  
• Environmental disturbances  

Traditional systems detect damage **after failure**.

Our solution predicts risk **before damage happens** using live sensor monitoring and predictive scoring.

## 🛰️ System Architecture

The system consists of two main dashboards:

### 1️⃣ Live Monitoring Dashboard (Real-Time)

This dashboard provides real-time monitoring of optical fiber health.

### Features:

- 🌍 Live GIS Map of Tamil Nadu Optical Fiber Routes
- 📍 District-wise Node Monitoring
- 📊 Real-Time Sensor Readings (Vibration, Gyroscope, Light)
- ⚠ Live Alert Feed (Critical / Warning)
- 🧠 Risk Engine (Health Score + Risk %)
- 🔋 Node Health Monitoring (Battery, Signal, Firmware)
- 📈 Analytics (24-hour trends & district incidents)
- 📄 Report & Export System (CSV, PDF, GIS snapshot)
- 👤 Role-based Access (Admin / Operator / Viewer)

This dashboard simulates how real industrial systems monitor fiber backbone networks across multiple districts.

### 2️⃣ Detection History & Predictive Simulation Dashboard

This dashboard uses a structured dummy dataset to demonstrate:

- 📅 Historical incident logs
- 🔍 Filter by Date / District / Cable ID
- 🧾 Technician notes & resolution tracking
- 📉 Incident severity classification
- 🧠 Pre-incident spike detection logic

This demonstrates how the system would operate at industrial scale using:

- Long-term sensor data storage
- Event classification models
- Predictive alerting mechanisms
- Risk zone mapping

---

## 🔬 Sensor Model Used

Each fiber node simulates:

• Vibration Sensor (Hz)  
• Gyroscope (°/s)  
• Light Sensor (lux)  

Sensor fusion logic classifies events such as:

- Drilling
- Heavy Vehicle Movement
- Cable Exposure
- Environmental Noise

Risk Score is calculated based on:

- Sensor intensity
- Historical alert frequency
- District risk weight
- Node health condition

---

## 🧠 Predictive Intelligence

The system predicts potential damage using:

- Threshold-based anomaly detection
- Sensor fusion classification
- Risk scoring algorithm
- Health degradation modeling
- Alert prioritization (P1, P2, P3)

This enables proactive maintenance instead of reactive repair.

## 🗺️ Tamil Nadu Optical Fiber Coverage

The GIS map visualizes:

- Fiber backbone routes
- District-level nodes
- High-risk drilling zones
- Past incident markers
- Real-time color-coded health indicators

---

## 🏭 Industrial-Level Implementation Vision

In real-world deployment, this system would integrate:

- Distributed ESP-based sensor nodes
- LoRa / GSM / NB-IoT communication
- Centralized NOC server
- Machine Learning anomaly detection
- Automated field dispatch system
- Government infrastructure integration

This project demonstrates scalable architecture for state-wide fiber surveillance.
